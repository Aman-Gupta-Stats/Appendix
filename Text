Hi Team,

Following our recent hackathon discussion, I made some progress on refining the network graph.

HTML Version:
	•	Transaction Movement: Added directional transaction lines.
	•	Time Player: Shows cumulative transactions over time (can be adjusted to show only current-day transactions if needed).
	•	Legend: Included for better context.

However, HTML didn’t support adding a time filter effectively. Since we’re planning to present the final version in Streamlit, I tried building the same directly there. Fortunately, Streamlit supports folium out of the box.

Streamlit Version:
	•	Time Filter + Company Filter: Enabled using a slider.
	•	Cumulative Transactions: Displayed with directional lines.
	•	Next/Previous Transaction: Added navigation (Play button is currently non-functional).

Areas for Team Alignment / Improvement:
	•	Handling coinciding transaction lines, especially when moving in opposite directions.
	•	Improving tooltip visibility when multiple lines overlap.
