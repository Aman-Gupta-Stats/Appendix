We’ll begin by revisiting Python’s fundamental data types, learning how to represent and manipulate different kinds of data. With that foundation in place, we’ll move on to loops, which let you automate repetitive tasks and traverse collections effortlessly. Next, we’ll explore list comprehensions, a concise way to transform and filter lists in a single, readable line. Building on that, if-else statements will introduce decision-making logic into your programs. Afterward, we’ll bundle code into reusable functions, improving modularity and clarity. Finally, we’ll cover exception handling so you can anticipate errors and keep your programs running smoothly.
